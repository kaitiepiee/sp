# Simulation-Project
## Cache Memory Simulator 
This is a Simulation Project for CSARCH2 by group 4. The project is a Cache simulator (Full associative / LRU) made as a web application that is intended for users to simulate cache memory management. The application displays the total hits, misses, average access time, number of memory accesses. 

## Features
- simulator uses Full Associative Mapping
- simulator uses the *Least Recently Used* (LRU) replacement algorithm

## How to Use
1. User must input the size of a block
2. User must input the size of the main memory in number of blocks or words
3. User must input the size of the cache memory in numbers of blocks or words
4. User must input a squence of numbers seperated by commas (without spaces)
5. User must input the total time unit for a miss
6. Press simulate and see results
